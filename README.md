A desktop time tracker built with Python and PyQt5. This application lets you start new projects, continue tracking ongoing projects, and view or export all tracking records. It uses an SQLite database to store project data and time logs, and you can export records to Excel or PDF (with ReportLab installed).

Overview
The Time Tracker application provides a user-friendly interface to manage project time tracking. It includes the following features:

Start a New Project: Create a project by entering a title and details. A dedicated database table is created for each project.
Continue Tracking: Resume tracking for projects that aren’t currently active.
Running Project: View details of the currently active project, including start time.
All Records: Review all project logs in a table format with options to filter by project.
Export Records: Export tracking records to Excel (via Pandas) or PDF (via ReportLab).
The application also reads a configuration file (config.json) for UI styles and preferences. If the file does not exist, a default configuration is created.
